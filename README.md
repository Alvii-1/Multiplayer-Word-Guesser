Multi-Client networked Word Guessing Game (note to self, find catchier name for this project)

Server / Client code for a networked, multi-threaded game which allows players to connect remotely and play an automated game against the server. The goal of the game is to guess multiple words from three categories, and when all words are found, the user wins the game. If the user fails to guess all of the words, the game is lost.

The game is built with Java and JavaFX, using CSS for style.

WIP!
